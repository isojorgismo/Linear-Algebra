# LINEAR-ALGEBRA

This repository contains solutions to selected exercises from the third edition of *LINEAR ALGEBRA* by Kenneth Hoffman and Ray Kunze.

Each exercise is written in its own `.tex` file. Files are organized into folders corresponding to their respective sections, which are in turn contained within the folder of their corresponding chapter.

Overly trivial exercises are omitted.
